        <p>As the eighth of nine siblings, Henry is literally Henry the Eighth. Being a literature graduate, his passions include reading overly pretentious books (and pretending to understand them), succumbing to compulsive writing fits at 3:00AM, and secretly correcting people's grammar in the middle of conversations.</p>

        <p>On any given Saturday, you'll find him at one of two places: a thrift store (where he buys literally hundreds of books he'll never read) or playing tennis (in an attempt to build up some glutes that rival Serena Williams'). Henry can eat more tacos than you and can proudly say he's seen every episode of The Golden Girls.</p>
